User input: Introduction / Purpose
Disability advocacy helps protect and promote the rights of people with disabilities. Independent advocates, funded by the government, work only for the person they support. They help those who face big challenges or can't speak up for themselves, especially if they don't have family or friends to help them. They can get support from these advocates.
Intelife also values the role of families, friends, and other providers in protecting the rights of people with disabilities. If informal advocates need help, they should first talk to Intelife. If they still can't solve the problem, they should contact an independent advocate.
Scope
